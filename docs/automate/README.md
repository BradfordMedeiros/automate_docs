# *automate* #
------------

### Description ###
**automate** is an open source home automation software for the hobbiest electronics enthusiast.
The inspiration is to create a common software platform for the likes of people who actually like electronics and programming.
Noob friendly and not configuration hell, but still for the programmer.  And for the non-programmer.  Not for the corporation.


No data stealing. Nothing proprietary.  Not a black box.  Simple.


Let's augment your Arduino, RapsberryPi, ESP8266, Mbed, whatever you like.   
Make them talk together.  Give them easy-to-reprogram brains.  


See architecture for details (coming soon).
